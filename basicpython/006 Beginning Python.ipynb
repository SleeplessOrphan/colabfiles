This construct is Python's equivalent of the `switch/case` structure found in many other programming languages. It provides a more streamlined and readable way to perform complex comparisons and multi-way branching. In this construct, `match` takes an expression and compares its value against successive `case` patterns. When a matching pattern is found, the corresponding block of code is executed.\n","\n","#### Iteration\n","- **While Loop**\n","  - The `while` loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. It's an example of indefinite iteration, where the number of times the loop runs isn’t specified explicitly in advance. Instead, it depends on the condition and will continue looping until the condition evaluates to False. This makes `while` loops ideal for situations where the number of iterations isn’t known before the loop starts.\n","\n","- **For Loop**\n","  - The `for` loop in Python is used for iterating over a sequence, which could be a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string. This kind of loop is an example of definite iteration, where the number of iterations is defined by the length of the sequence over which it is looping. Each iteration of the loop takes an element from the sequence and executes the block of code with this element. `for` loops are widely used for their simplicity and ability to iterate over items of any sequence type, not just ranges of numbers."],"metadata":{"id":"sU90FxOGoj2Y"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Short Exercises to Practice Each Command\n","\n","#### 1.
