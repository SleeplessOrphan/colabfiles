For example, `x = 5` means that `x` holds the value `5`.\n","\n","The `input()` function allows you to get a value from the user. This function always returns a string, so sometimes you may need to convert it to a different type like a number.\n","\n","### Step 2: Collecting User Input for Operations\n","\n","Add the following line to your code box. This will display a message asking the user to select an operation, and it stores the selected operation in a variable named operation.\n","\n","```python\n","operation = input(\"Select operation (+, -, *, /): \")\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ilZS_cZ9W6MH"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"jGLbtnFeW3FL"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Enter your code here\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 3: Collecting User Input for Numbers\n","\n","We need two numbers from the user to perform the calculation.
