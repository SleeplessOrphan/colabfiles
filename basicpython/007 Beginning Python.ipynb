In this lesson, we will look at some of the more advanced aspects of Python programming, specifically focusing on built-in functions and the use of standard libraries. These elements are fundamental to enhancing your efficiency and capability as a Python programmer.\n","\n","Understanding built-in functions and standard libraries is crucial. These features of Python not only simplify your code but also significantly expand what you can achieve with minimal effort. By mastering these tools, you'll be able to write more sophisticated and efficient programs.\n","\n","This lesson is designed to build upon your existing knowledge of Python. We assume familiarity with basic Python commands such as handling input and output (`input()`, `print()`), data type conversion (`int()`, `str()`, `float()`), and basic control structures (`if`, `else`, `elif`, `while`, `for`)."],"metadata":{"id":"A673mqpGb8Jm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Definitions for Each Python Command as a Reference\n","\n","#### Import\n","The `import` statement in Python is used to include external modules in a script. A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. By using `import`, you can access the functions, classes, and variables defined in that module. For example, `import math` allows you to use mathematical functions defined in the `math` module.\n","\n","#### From\n","The `from` keyword enhances the `import` statement, allowing you to import specific attributes or functions from a module, rather than the entire module. This can be useful for conserving memory or making your code more readable. For instance, `from math import sqrt` imports only the `sqrt` function from the `math` module.\n","\n","#### As\n","`as` is used in conjunction with `import` to rename a module or function for easier reference in your code. This can be particularly useful when dealing with modules or functions with long or inconvenient names. For example, `import datetime as dt` lets you use `dt` as a shorthand for `datetime`, making your code cleaner and more concise.\n","\n","#### \\*\n","Using `*` with the `import` statement (e.g., `from math import *`) imports all functions, classes, and variables defined in a module. While this may seem convenient, it's generally discouraged because it can lead to namespace pollution. Namespace pollution occurs when your current namespace gets filled with a lot of variables and functions from the imported module, which can lead to conflicts with your own defined names or with names from other imported modules. It’s better practice to import only what you need or use the standard import statement."],"metadata":{"id":"2Hv8Vje3cNEU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Built-in Functions and Standard Libraries\n","\n","#### Math\n","The `math` module in Python provides access to various mathematical functions and constants.\n","\n","- **Usage Example**:\n","  ```python\n","  import math\n","\n","  # Using a mathematical function\n","  print(\"Cosine of 45 degrees: \", math.cos(math.radians(45)))\n","\n","  # Accessing a constant\n","  print(\"Value of PI: \", math.pi)\n","  ```\n","\n","In this example, we use `math.cos()` to calculate the cosine of 45 degrees, converting degrees to radians using `math.radians()`. We also access the constant `math.pi` to get the value of π.\n","\n","#### Random\n","The `random` module is used for generating random numbers and choosing random elements from a list.\n","\n","- **Usage Example**:\n","  ```python\n","  import random\n","\n","  # Generating a random number between 0 and 1\n","  print(\"Random number between 0 and 1: \", random.random())\n","\n","  # Choosing a random element from a list\n","  choices = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n","  print(\"Random fruit choice: \", random.choice(choices))\n","  ```\n","\n","Here, `random.random()` generates a random float number between 0 and 1. `random.choice()` selects a random element from the given list.\n","\n","#### Datetime\n","The `datetime` module in Python is used for manipulating dates and times.\n","\n","- **Usage Example**:\n","  ```python\n","  import datetime\n","\n","  # Current date and time\n","  now = datetime.datetime.now()\n","  print(\"Current date and time: \", now)\n","\n","  # Specific date\n","  independence_day = datetime.datetime(1776, 7, 4)\n","  print(\"Independence Day: \", independence_day)\n","  ```\n","\n","This example demonstrates getting the current date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()`, and creating a specific date by providing year, month, and day to `datetime.datetime()`.\n","\n","Each of these modules offers a wide range of functionalities that are crucial for various applications in Python programming."],"metadata":{"id":"BypVdfqncjfs"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_-Ig1Ikyb3lP"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Try some examples here\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Short Exercises to Practice Each Command\n","\n","#### Exercise 1: Using Import\n","- **Objective**: Write a Python script to import the `math` module and calculate the square root of 16.\n","- **Hint**: Use `math.sqrt()`.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"A5bFEeSocxpl"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Your code goes here\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HpYJNynqdDuF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Exercise 2: Using From\n","- **Objective**: Write a script that imports only the `randint` function from the `random` module and generates a random integer between 1 and 10.\n","- **Hint**: Use `from random import randint`.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"UAW0ZLTFdD8R"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Your code goes here\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bU4UzdZxdGew"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Exercise 3: Using As\n","- **Objective**: Import the `datetime` module using the alias `dt` and print the current date.\n","- **Hint**: Use `import datetime as dt` and `dt.date.today()`.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JpfcWSS0dM0p"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Your code goes here\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wLCxf6mwdM-i"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Exercise 4: Using *\n","- **Objective**: Import everything from the `statistics` module and calculate the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n","- **Caution**: Be aware of the potential issues with namespace pollution when using `*`.\n","- **Hint**: Use `from statistics import *` and `mean()`.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hYx0LuITdNIG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Your code goes here\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"y1mYmmANdNQw"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Longer Exercise: Generating Timestamps and Randomised Data for Simulation\n","\n","#### Objective\n","Create a Python script that performs the following tasks:\n","1.
