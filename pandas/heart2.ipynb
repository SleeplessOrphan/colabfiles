Consider using the `hist()` function from Matplotlib to create the histogram; this will give you a visual representation of the distribution.\n","2. To calculate skewness, you may want to use the `skew()` function available within the pandas library.\n","3. When interpreting skewness, remember that a value closer to 0 suggests a symmetrical distribution, while a positive or negative value indicates a skew to the right or left, respectively.\n","\n","### Hints for Task 2: Chest Pain and Exercise-Induced Angina\n","\n","1. To create the bar chart, first aggregate the data using `groupby` on 'cp' and count the occurrences of 'exng'.\n","2. When plotting, consider using the `bar()` function from Matplotlib and make sure to label your axes clearly.\n","3. Reflect on the clinical significance of chest pain that triggers angina during exercise and what that might mean for patients with different types of chest pain.\n","\n","### Hints for Task 3: Fasting Blood Sugar and Cholesterol Levels\n","\n","1. Use `groupby` to segment the data into groups where 'fbs' is 0 or 1, and then calculate the mean of 'chol' for these groups.\n","2. The `boxplot()` function from Matplotlib can help visualise the cholesterol level distributions for the two 'fbs' groups. Remember to look for differences in the median, as well as the spread and outliers in the data.\n","3. Discuss the potential implications considering what high fasting blood sugar levels might indicate for a person's metabolism and how this could be related to cholesterol levels.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SfRlOuVyovMd"}}]}
